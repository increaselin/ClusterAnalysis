# This file contains an example format for new line lists to be entered
# into the sqlite3 atomic line database.
# Note: All lines prefaced with # are ignored as comments
#
# The first line designates the format of the individual line information
# column designations are:
# wl : wavelength in Angstroms
# ion : element/ionization state in XX.Y format - ie. Fe II = 26.1
# ep : excitation potential of the lower state
# wn : wave number of the lower state
# loggf : the loggf value for this line
# ref : the number of the (primary) reference listed at end of file
#         If omitted, it is assumed that this reference is the primary
#         source, or modified another primary source.
# damp : the (vanDerWaals) damping coefficient (optional)
#         If omitted, existing values (if the line is already in the DB)
#         or average of other values of the same element will be used.
# solar : the width of this ine (in mA) in the Solar spectrum (optional)
# note : (Must end the text line) A character string containing notes
#        on this line.
#
format: ion wl ep loggf ref
# All sections must be separated by a set of five(5) dashes

# The references section begins after the first ----- after the 
# line list. The first reference will be the article from which
# the lines were taken. Subsequent publications are matched with 
# the reference numbers given in the 'ref' column of the lines
# above. These refs are entered as the primary source for the 
# line information with this paper (source) listed as the secondary.
#
# Each entry has the format:
#
# First author name (Last, Init.)
# Article title (optional - leave blank if omitted)
# Publication date (year month day) (month and day are optional)
# Publication (abbreviation)
# Volume information (Volume Issue)
