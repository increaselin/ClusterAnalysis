# Description: Spectral lines used to correct for Doppler shifts.
#
# Data Format: [(wavelength, ion, excit. pot., log(gf), weight, solar eqw, notes), ...]

#                   line weight range: [1.0...3.9]
#                       Weight 3.x: Narrow lines, common in all spectra
#                       Weight 2.x: Broader lines (ex: Na doublet), use only if best lines not available
#                                   Also, single lines in a nearby series 
#                                   (ie: each line in the O triplet has weight 2.0)
#                                   (Fraunhofer lines are 2.1 by default)
#                       Weight 1.x: Very broad lines (ex: H-alpha), use only if no other available
#

# Note 1: This is the standard form for a line list, but we substitute the second to last column
#           (normally the c6 damping factor) for the line weight.
# Note 2: Excitation potential, solar eqw, and log(gf) are not important in these calculations,
#           and several lines without these values are included, using a 99.999 filler value
